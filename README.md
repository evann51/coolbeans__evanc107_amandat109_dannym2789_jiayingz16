A blog website capable of hosting user-created blogs for others to view and edit depending on their permission level.
# Launch Codes:
   Installation - At the top of the page, click the green button that says "Code." In the dropdown that appears, click "Download Zip" at the bottom.<br>
   <br>
   Cloning - At the top of the page, click the green button that says "Code." In the dropdown that appears, choose either "HTTPS" or "SSH" under the "Clone" section and copy the provided URL. Open up your computer's terminal and type "git clone {URL HERE}"<br>
   <br>
   Running - Make/activate a virtual environment, ensure that flask is installed, change directories in the terminal to the "app" file within the downloaded/cloned folder and run the python script inside with "python3 {{scriptname}}." A 127.0.0.1:5000 link should appear in the terminal - open the link and the website will be shown. <br>
